# autogram
Automates uploading top post of a subreddit to an instagram page.

## Overview
This Python script automates the process of fetching top posts from a specific subreddit (in this case, 'memes') and posting them to Instagram. The script is designed to run once a day, downloading a top post and uploading it to an Instagram account.

## Features
- **Automated Scheduling:** Runs daily at a specified time using GitHub Actions.
- **Image Handling:** Downloads images from Reddit and handles image storage temporarily in the GitHub repository.
- **Instagram Integration:** Automatically uploads the image to a specified Instagram account.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- A GitHub account.
- A Reddit account with API access.
- An Instagram account.
- Python installed on your machine (preferably Python 3.11).
